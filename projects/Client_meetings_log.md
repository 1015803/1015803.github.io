1/15/26 Meeting one- I was asked to create a website for my dads realtoring business which he does as a side hustle and to include info about him and the company he works for. He also wanted pictures of him, a sleek design and methods of contacting him. 

1/26/26 Meeting two-I checked in with him to confirm that the information was correct and the initial formatting was desired. He asked to rewrite some of the text himself and asked for the format to include photos above the text instead of to the side of it.

1/30/26 Meeting three- I showed him the final page with links and methods of contacting and confirmed he didn't want to change anything about the layout or design. He wanted to change the color scheme and change the email from his personal to his realtor specific.

2/2/26 meeting four- I confirmed that the website would be ready to publish and that there was no more feedback. He had no feedback this time.
