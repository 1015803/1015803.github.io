  <p>
    Shepherds pie is a Scottish recipe that is often made in my family. Although my family doesn't have a specific family recipe unlike for shortbread it is still a staple of Scottish heritage in my family.

  <p>For this recipe you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1½ pounds (700 g) potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk (adjust for desired mash consistency)</li>
    <li>1 lb (450 g) ground lamb (or ground beef for a cottage pie)</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
    <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup beef or lamb stock</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh)</li>
    <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Olive oil or vegetable oil for cooking</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
    <li>Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, about 15–20 minutes. Drain and mash with 2 tablespoons of butter and the milk; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>While the potatoes cook, heat 1–2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and carrots and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the ground lamb and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat if necessary.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato paste, stock, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper. Simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, 5–8 minutes. Stir in the peas and remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Transfer the meat mixture to a baking dish (about 9x13-inch or similar). Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top; use a fork to texture the surface and dot with the remaining butter.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20–25 minutes, until the top is golden and the filling is bubbling. For a more browned top, place under the broiler for 2–3 minutes—watch closely to avoid burning.</li>
    <li>Let the shepherd's pie rest for 5–10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
